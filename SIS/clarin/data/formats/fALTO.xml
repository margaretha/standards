    <p>ALTO (Analyzed Layout and Text Object) is an open XML Schema developed by the EU-funded
      project called METAe.</p>
    <p>The standard was initially developed for the description of text OCR and layout information
      of pages for digitized material. The goal was to describe the layout and text in a form to be
      able to reconstruct the original appearance based on the digitized information - similar to
      the approach of a lossless image saving operation.</p>
    <p>ALTO is often
      <a href="https://github.com/altoxml/documentation/wiki/Using-ALTO-with-METS">used
      in combination with Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS)</a> for the
      description of the whole digitized object and creation of references across the ALTO files,
      e.g. reading sequence description.</p>
    <p>The standard is hosted by the Library of Congress since 2010 and maintained by the Editorial
      Board initialized at the same time.</p>
    <p>In the time from the final version of the ALTO standard in June 2004 (version 1.0) ALTO was
      maintained by CCS Content Conversion Specialists GmbH, Hamburg up to version 1.4. See:
