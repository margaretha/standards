# The vault

This directory stores documents that may otherwise be difficult to locate (finding them took a bit of effort and wait).

Among others:

* Global Digital Format Registry (GDFR) data model, v. 5.0.10, retrieved from the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20110409232812/http://www.gdfr.info/).
* GDFR Ontology, v1 (probably the latest one, from 2003)
* A paper on the GDFR Architecture, "Using Scalable and Secure Web Technologies to Design a Global
Digital Format Registry Prototype: Architecture, Implementation, and Testing"
* Unified Digital Format Registry (UDFR) proposal -- UDFR was a short-term descendant of GFDR, running in 2011-2012; it would be nice to see if it's produced any documents
* GDFR Classification v. 1.0.5 -- copied from [LoC documentation](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd_explanation.shtml) and stored here redundantly, 
for the sake of completeness. It serves as the basis for the "gdfr" set of keywords used for format descriptions.
