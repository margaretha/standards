This directory contains some potential documentation for the Format Recommendation subsystem of the SIS.

The source files have been created with the Freeplane software from work originally done for the CSC by 
Hanna Hedeland, with some help from the other members. These files end in .mm

Each of them has been exported as PNG, and the HTML export is meant to make the notes accompanying the Functional Formats map easier to access.
